# Handoff - Figma Plugin

**Handoff** is a Figma plugin designed to streamline the design-to-development process by creating a basic handoff sheet that iterates through variants for each property definition. This makes it easier to share design component variations with developers in a clear and organized manner.

## Features

- Automatically generates a handoff sheet for Figma components.
- Lists variants for each property definition.
- Simplifies the design-to-development communication.
- Easy-to-use and time-saving tool for design teams.

## Installation

To install and use **Handoff**:

1. Go to the [Figma Plugin Directory](https://www.figma.com/community/plugins).
2. Search for **Handoff**.
3. Click on **Install** to add the plugin to your Figma account.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and build the plugin locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt0rtega/handoff.git
```

## Usage

1. In your Figma file, select the components or variants you want to hand off.
2. Open the **Handoff** plugin from the Figma plugin menu.
3. **Handoff** will generate a basic handoff sheet, iterating through each variant property.
4. Review or edit the sheet as needed before sharing it with developers.

### Example

Here’s a quick example of how the generated handoff sheet might look:

- **Component**: Button
  - **Property 1**: Size (Small, Medium, Large)
  - **Property 2**: Color (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
  - **Property 3**: State (Active, Disabled, Hover)

The handoff sheet will iterate over these properties and list all possible combinations.
